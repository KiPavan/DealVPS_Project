Here is an improved version of your instructions:

1. **Setting Up Your Java IDE:**

   First, download and install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java. Popular options include Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans. Choose one that suits your preferences and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Install a REST API Testing Tool:**

   To interact with your RESTful API, you'll need a tool like Postman. Download and install Postman from their official website (https://www.postman.com/).

3. **Running Your Java Project:**

   In your IDE, open the Java project that contains your REST API implementation. Locate and run the "vpsApplication.java" file.

4. **Server Port Configuration:**

   Ensure that your application is configured to listen on port 8080. Check the code or configuration files to confirm this setting.

5. **Testing Your REST API:**

   Open Postman and create requests to test your REST API. You can use the GET method to retrieve data and the POST method to save data to the server. Configure the request URL and parameters as needed to interact with your API endpoints.
